Project 2
CS-482/CS-502
Python Version: 3.10.2

Team Members: Miguel Fernandez, Camika Leiva, Isaias Melendez

Work Allocation:
The work allocation for this project was dynamic since each query required different specifications
and different constraints. In summary the work allocation was divided roughly into thirds with
gradual progression and incremental changes to each function. All of us also managed error checking
and providing comments for each function so that this project was well documented.
